  Bustling with activity, we tried street food and took in our first morning in
  Bangkok.

We awoke to the sound of bird calls and bustling people awaking to a new day.

The alley that was so quiet and dark last night when we tried to find our Airbnb was now alive with the bustle of motorcycles, tuktuks, street food vendors, small shops, kids walking to school, and even industrial production. We passed a printing press company, mechanics, welders, paint stores, producing smells and sounds of every kind.

We tried some satay (street meat kebab) and sat down at a corner across from the bank for our first local soup. The corner street food place seemed to be a favourite with local motorcycle taxi drivers. If the locals trust it, we could too!

## SIM

According to our friends we met for lunch, the travel SIM at the airport is the best deal around. $400-800 Baht (~$16-32CAD) for 12GB data over 15 days. 

*“O Canada, our home and good-cell-planless land...”*

## Grab, the hero we deserve
Grab, even for its shortfalls in drivers calling you (you don’t have to pick up) and their not supporting regular credit cards... is still much better than taxi.

For example, we tried to take a taxi back from Asiatique on the river. After a block of repeatedly asking what hotel we were going to and us trying to explain our Airbnb location in a soi (alley) the driver finally understood that we were going to an apartment, an Airbnb, and exclaimed that we needed to take another taxi. 

We got out at the next block, booked a Grab, and it arrived in 2 minutes. Our guess is that the taxis around the touristy Asiatique night market have a deal with the hotels to transport guests back and forth. 

Grab is great, when they finally arrive, since they already have your address loaded up and you can avoid haphazardly trying to explain an address in a foreign language.
