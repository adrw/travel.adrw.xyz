## Some call it Saigon

Though renamed following the fall of the city at the terminus of the Vietnam War, I was surprised by the number of shops, companies, and people who still used the old name of Saigon.

This city, shaped by the long French rule, also showed some influence from the shorter time when it was central to American operations in the country. People are a bit louder and accostive in the streets in comparison to Hanoi in the North. Food has more spice and richer flavours.

## Insider Information

We met up with a friend, who we’ll call Kevin, who grew up in the city and also spent 10 years overseas in a Western country for university and work. He was kind enough to show us the local Ben Than?**\_\_** market, his favourite rooftop bar, and give us a local’s understanding of Vietnam.

His perspective was different than what we had heard other places, partly because he had spent such a long time out of the country that he now understood a bit better the alternative lifestyles, government and economic systems, and narratives that exist concerning Vietnam.
