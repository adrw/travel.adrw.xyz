## Lunch with Amber and Matthew
We had the privilege to get connected with Amber and Matthew through the pastor who married Suzie and I. Amber and Matthew have lived all over Europe and now in Thailand as missionaries so we were excited to hear their experience and perspective on the city over lunch. 

Arriving before us with their 7 month old, they were so welcoming wanting to learn about our story and suggesting their favourite dishes at the restaurant, 

## SIM

According to our friends we met for lunch, the travel SIM at the airport is the best deal around. $400-800 Baht (~$16-32CAD) for 12GB data over 15 days. 

*“O Canada, our home and good-cell-planless land...”*

## Grab, the hero we deserve
Grab, even for its shortfalls in drivers calling you (you don’t have to pick up) and their not supporting regular credit cards... is still much better than taxi.

For example, we tried to take a taxi back from Asiatique on the river. After a block of repeatedly asking what hotel we were going to and us trying to explain our Airbnb location in a soi (alley) the driver finally understood that we were going to an apartment, an Airbnb, and exclaimed that we needed to take another taxi. 

We got out at the next block, booked a Grab, and it arrived in 2 minutes. Our guess is that the taxis around the touristy Asiatique night market have a deal with the hotels to transport guests back and forth. 

Grab is great, when they finally arrive, since they already have your address loaded up and you can avoid haphazardly trying to explain an address in a foreign language.
