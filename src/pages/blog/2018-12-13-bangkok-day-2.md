# Ride the Bus

There are many different categories of buses in Thailand and you can save a lot of Baht if you take them instead of taxis or Grab. 

| Colour | Rate | Flat or Distance Dependent | Air Conditioning | Other notes |
|—-|—-|—-|—-|—-|
| Red | 7B | Flat | No | Regular bus or  “two bench” back of a pick up truck variety | 


**Red** 7B: No air conditioning. Can be regular buses or the “two bench” back of a pick up truck variety.

**Orange** 11-24B: Air conditioned. Rate is distance dependent. 

**Yellow** 10-12B: Air conditioned. 

**Other non air conditioned** 8B.
